## How It's Made:
**Tech Used**: HTML & CSS

This website mock-up was built to highlight my HTML and CSS skills. In particular, box layouts, floats and working with media queries to make the website responsive and maintain it's integrity over different screen sizes. The box layout for this website was created using floats. Floats was chosen as the framework to showcase my understanding of floats on a functional website. After the box layout was created, media queries were created to get a rough estimate of how the website would look moving across different screen sizes. After a few media queries were placed as a foundation, the next step was creating and inserting all the elements on the page inside of their corresponding sections. This was the most time consuming part of the project, as I enjoy styling and wanted to make everything look as close to the real website as possible, down to the pixel. 

## Lessons Learned: 

Prior to completing this project, I was struggling to understand media queries and how to make them more cohesive. This project helped me grasp media queries in a new way. By working starting with a large screen size and working my way down to mobile phone sized screens, I was able to understand how media queries are used to make the overall functionality of websites more optimal.
